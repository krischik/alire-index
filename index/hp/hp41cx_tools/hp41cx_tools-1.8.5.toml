## HP-41CX Emulator Tools

Step into the golden era of retro computing with **hp41cx_tools**, a versatile
suite that turbocharges your HP-41CX emulator adventures! Unlike many tools
shackled to Windows, this toolkit runs flawlessly on **macOS**, **Linux**, and
**Windows**, making it the ultimate companion for enthusiasts using the iconic
[PX-41CX](https://paxer.net/PX-41CX/) from Paxer or the sleek
[DM41X](https://www.swissmicros.com/product/dm41x) from SwissMicros. Channel
your inner 1980s programming wizard and master memory dumps, FOCAL source code,
*and now encoding* with ease - compiling any FOCAL straight into upload-ready
dump files for the PX-41CY emulator.

Built with the precision of **Ada 2022** for unshakeable reliability, these
tools decode, convert, and encode data with the finesse of the HP-41CX's
legendary keystrokes. Paired with intuitive **ZShell scripts** for macOS and
Linux, the suite streamlines complex workflows, whether you're on a modern
MacBook, a Linux workstation, or a Windows PC. This cross-platform prowess
ensures every retro computing fan can join the fun, no matter their
setup - grateful shoutout to Pierre Houbert's pioneering
[PX41CX_Interface.xls](https://paxer.net/PX-41CX_Interface.zip) and its
VisualBasic wizardry, which lit the fuse for this focused PX-41CX/DM41X
journey.

### Key Features

- **Memory Dump Decoder**: Transform raw HP-41CX emulator memory dumps into
  readable FOCAL source code with pinpoint accuracy.
- **Source Code Converter**: Seamlessly convert between PX-41CX and DM41X FOCAL
  code styles, bridging emulator ecosystems.
- **FOCAL Encoder**: Compile modern UTF-8 encoded FOCAL programs into precise
  dump files, ready for PX-41CY emulator upload - vintage vibes meet UTF-8
  pipelines.
- **Unicode Support**: Convert Unicode-encoded FOCAL programs to PX-41CX or
  DM41X formats, blending vintage charm with modern workflows.
- **Cross-Platform Power**: Runs natively on macOS, Linux, and Windows - like a
  portable Ada generic, no OS exceptions.
- **Open Source**: Hosted on
  [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/calculator-scripts/code/ci/master/tree/Tools/hp41cx_tools/src/),
  ready for you to hack, extend, and share with the retro computing community.
- **Comprehensive Docs**: Explore detailed guides via
  [GNATdoc](https://calculator-scripts.sourceforge.io/gnatdoc/hp41cx-tools).

### Why You'll Love It

Relive the thrill of programming the HP-41CX, the calculator that defined a
generation of scientific and hobbyist triumphs. Whether you're decoding vintage
memory dumps, converting code styles, or encoding fresh FOCAL scripts,
**hp41cx_tools** brings the past to life with unmatched versatility. Join the
retro computing revolution and make your emulator sing - on any desktop OS!
