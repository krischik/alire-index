long-description = """
ALI_Parse is a parser for the .ali files generated by the GNAT Ada compiler.
ALI means Ada Library Information.
You find the .ali files in the same directories as the object files (.o) containing the machine code produced by GNAT.

Currently, ALI_Parse is focused at cross-references within a set of Ada source files.
Two command-line tools using the parser are provided:

* GNATHTML, which generates a set of Web pages from Ada sources
* ALI_Stats, which shows the list of entities, the list of cross-references, the count of references to each entity and the list of files.

ALI_Parse is pure Ada 2012 and doesn't depend on any other resource.
